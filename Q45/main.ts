// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function creat_car(manufacturer, model, ...options) {

    let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
    };
    options.forEach(option => {
        let[key, value] = option.split(":");
        car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });
    return car;
}
