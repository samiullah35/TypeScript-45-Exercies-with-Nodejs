// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (name) { return "The great ".concat(name); });
}
var magicians_name = ["asad", "owais", "riaz"];
var great_magicines = make_great(magicians_name);
show_magicians(great_magicines);
